# Apple Music Lyrics Extension **[WIP!]**

Just a small extension to get the lyrics of songs in Apple Music

Tested on Firefox 92 for Linux.

If you want to try it out, here's a tutorial on [temporarily installing an extension (by Mozilla)](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) or [installing unsigned extensions permanently to Firefox (by wiringbits)](https://wiringbits.net/browser-extensions/2020/11/27/installing-unsigned-extensions-permanently-to-firefox.html)
